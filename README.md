# BrainHeart-StrokeRisk

This repository provides the code and resources for estimating **biological age** through **brain-heart interactions (BHI)** and evaluating **stroke risk** based on EEG and ECG data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS).

## Overview
The goal of this project is to utilize **polysomnography (PSG)** signals, specifically **EEG** and **ECG**, to estimate a patientâ€™s biological age using a **local lead-attention model**. By comparing the predicted biological age with the chronological age, we assess stroke risk. Our results demonstrate that **joint brain-heart interactions** significantly outperform single-modality approaches.


### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Python** >= 3.9
- **PyTorch**

  
### Dataset
To train and evaluate the model, you need the **SHHS dataset**.

1. **Download the dataset**:  
   Access the SHHS dataset from the National Sleep Research Resource:  
   [Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs)

2. **Preprocess the data**:  
   Run the preprocessing script to filter and divide the PSG signals into epochs.
   ```bash
   python preprocess/filter_divide_epochs_shhs_v4.py
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Preprocess Data
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the SHHS dataset:
```bash
python preprocess/filter_divide_epochs_shhs_v4.py
```
This will generate preprocessed EEG and ECG signals divided into epochs.

### Training
To train the local lead-attention model on the preprocessed data:
```
python train.py --measure both
```
Also train for measures *ecg* and *eeg*
Training requires you to download the dataset first and preprocess it with *preprocess/filter_divide_epochs_shhs_v4.py*

### Testing
The predictions for each measure are stored in the folder *outputs*.
Use the following command to generate the pdf to analyse the results - This works without downloading additional data as the predictions are stored in this repo.
```
python generate_report.py
```
Also use the *results.ipynb* to see additional analysis.
